Real-time JS object synchronisation over SSE and WebSockets in Go and JavaScript (Node.js and browser)

### Features

* Simple API
* Synchronise any JSON marshallable struct in Go
* Supports [Server-Sent Events (EventSource)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) and [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)
* SSE [client-side poly-fill](https://github.com/remy/polyfills/blob/master/EventSource.js) to fallback to long-polling in older browsers (IE8+).
* Implement delta queries (return all results, then incrementally return changes)

### Quick Usage

Server (Go)

``` go
//syncable struct
type Foo struct {
	velox.State
	A, B int
}
foo := &Foo{}
//serve velox sync endpoint for foo
http.Handle("/sync", velox.SyncHandler(foo))
//make changes
foo.A = 42
foo.B = 21
//push to client
foo.Push()
```

Client (Node and Browser)

``` js
// load script /velox.js
var evtSource = new EventSource('http://127.0.0.1:3000/sync');
evtSource.onmessage = function(e) {
   var v =  JSON.parse(e.data)
};
```

### API

Server API (Go)

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/velox?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/velox)

Server API (Node)

* `velox.handle(object)` *function* returns `v` - Creates a new route handler for use with express
* `velox.state(object)` *function* returns `state` - Creates or restores a velox state from a given object
* `state.handle(req, res)` *function* returns `Promise` - Handle the provided `express` request/response. Resolves on connection close. Rejects on any error.

### Example

See this [simple `example/`](example/) and view it live here: https://velox.jpillora.com



*Here is a screenshot from this example page, showing the messages arriving as either a full replacement of the object or just a delta. The server will send which ever is smaller.*

### Notes

* JS object properties beginning with `$` will be ignored to play nice with Angular.
* JS object with an `$apply` function will automatically be called on each update to play nice with Angular.
* `velox.SyncHandler` is just a small wrapper around `velox.Sync`:

  ```go
  func SyncHandler(gostruct interface{}) http.Handler {
  	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  		if conn, err := Sync(gostruct, w, r); err == nil {
  			conn.Wait()
  		}
  	})
  }
  ```

### Known issues

* Object synchronization is currently one way (server to client) only.
* Object diff has not been optimized. It is a simple property-by-property comparison.

### TODO

* WebRTC support
* Plain [`http`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_requestlistener) server support in Node
